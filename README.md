# Cubic's Custom Catalog
Welcome to Cubic's Custom Catalog! 

This repository features many different projects I've made for various video game, mostly custom level mods.

Look into each game for more information.

# EDGE
This part of the repository features every custom EDGE level I've made and put out to the public at one point in time. This lists spin-off levels, remakes of already existing levels, levels I built with other people, and of course, levels that I made all by myself. To add new levels to your EDGE, simply place the .bin files into the "levels" folder and the .eso files into the "models folder. Then, add the level strings into the mapping.xml file found in the "levels" folder and place the strings underneath the "standard", "bonus", or "extended" elements (those strings are listed in the readme files provided in the folders of each level.)

Total Level Count: 19

# VVVVVV

This section of the repository features every custom level I have made for the game VVVVVV. Unlike EDGE, a level editor was built into the game, which also means a way to import custom levels with ease was also built into the game. To find out where you need to put these files at, open the game, head on over to "levels" and select "show level folder path". Be aware that this may reveal some personal info that you might not be comfortable with sharing if you are streaming or recording.
